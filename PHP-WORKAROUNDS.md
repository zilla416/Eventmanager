# If cPanel PHP change doesn't work, try these:

## Option 1: Create .user.ini file

**Location:** `public_html/eventmanager/.user.ini`

**Content:**
```ini
; Force PHP 8.2
engine = On
short_open_tag = Off
precision = 14
output_buffering = 4096
```

## Option 2: Try different .htaccess handlers

**Edit:** `public_html/eventmanager/.htaccess`

**Try these ONE AT A TIME** (comment out others with #):

```apache
# Try option 1 (cPanel/EasyApache)
AddHandler application/x-httpd-ea-php82 .php

# If above fails, try option 2
# AddHandler application/x-httpd-php82 .php

# If above fails, try option 3
# AddHandler application/x-httpd-php8.2 .php

# If above fails, try option 4
# AddHandler fcgid-script .php
# FCGIWrapper /usr/local/cpanel/cgi-sys/ea-php82 .php
```

## Option 3: Contact Hosting Support

**Email/Contact Gluwebsite Support:**

```
Subject: Enable PHP 8.2 for u230752.gluwebsite.nl

Hello,

I need PHP 8.2 or higher enabled for my account u230752.gluwebsite.nl, 
specifically for the /eventmanager directory.

I'm getting this error:
"Composer detected issues in your platform: Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version >= 8.2.0"

Could you please:
1. Enable PHP 8.2 (or 8.3) for my domain/account
2. Ensure these PHP extensions are enabled: pdo, pdo_mysql, mbstring, openssl, tokenizer, xml

Thank you!
```

## Option 4: Check if PHP 8.2 is even available

**Create this file:** `public_html/eventmanager/check-php.php`

```php
<?php
echo "Current PHP Version: " . phpversion();
echo "\n\nAvailable PHP versions on this server:\n";
if (function_exists('apache_get_modules')) {
    print_r(apache_get_modules());
}
phpinfo();
?>
```

**Visit:** https://u230752.gluwebsite.nl/eventmanager/check-php.php

This will show you:
- What PHP version you're currently running
- What versions might be available

**DELETE THIS FILE AFTER CHECKING** (security risk)

## Option 5: Alternative - Use Different Hosting

If Gluwebsite doesn't support PHP 8.2, consider:
- **000webhost** (free, supports PHP 8.x)
- **InfinityFree** (free, supports PHP 8.x)
- **Railway.app** (free tier, supports Laravel)
- **Heroku** (free tier with Laravel buildpack)

## Most Likely Issue:

Gluwebsite might only support up to PHP 8.1. In that case, you need to either:
1. Contact them to upgrade your account
2. Use different hosting
3. Downgrade Laravel (complicated, not recommended)

---

**What to try FIRST:**

1. Upload the updated `.htaccess` with multiple handlers
2. Test after each change
3. If none work, contact Gluwebsite support
